## Multiple Linear Regression

### Packages used:

`Numpy` `Pandas`

### About:

1. Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm.

2. It attempts to model the relationship between TWO variables by fitting
   a ”best-fit” line to the observed data points where the ”best-fit” line has
   the minimum sum of the squares of the vertical distance from each data
   point to the ”best-fit” line.

3. The method of minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical distance
   from each data point to the line is known as the method of least-squares.

4. The variables in Linear Regression is known as dependent variable and
   independent variable. The idea is to derive the independent variable using
   the dependent variable.

5. In Multiple Linear Regression, there are more than one dependent variable
   and exactly one independent variable.
